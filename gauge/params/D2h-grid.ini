# Simulation of the gauge model with D2h symmetry
#
# The phase diagram features three phases:
# O(3) (disordered), Dinfh (uniaxial), and D2h (biaxial).
# The transitions from the disordered to the uniaxial phase, as well as the
# subsequent transition from the uniaxial to the biaxial phase are described
# by rank-2 (quadrupolar) order parameters. There is also a regime where both
# transitions happen at the same time; in this case, the SVM will learn a super-
# position of both order parameters.
# All three colors per site are considered, and a single-site cluster is used.
#
# The machine is trained at 100 points which cover the relevant area of the
# phase diagram in a 10 x 10 regular grid using the the "grid" sweep policy.
# At each point in the phase diagram, 100 spin configurations are sampled.
#
# The samples are consequently labeled "P1" through "P100", according to their
# grid point using the "fixed_from_sweep" classifier. Unlike the scenario in
# described in `D2h-phase-diagram.ini`, this one does not assume any prior
# knowledge of the phase diagram.
#
# This results in a multiclassification problem with 100 distinct labels and
# 4950 transitions between labels. Obviously, many of these will be either
# redundant (because, in principle, any two points from the same two phases
# should learn the same order) or not physical (transitions between point within
# the same phase). Additionally, the sample size for each individual point is
# rather small. Instead, this kind of approach is intended to explore the
# previously unknown phase diagram by exploiting the bias criterion using the
# graph analysis.
#
# $ mpirun -n 4 gauge-sample D2h-grid.ini                      (approx. 33 mins)
#     runs the simulation, collects samples and saves those to
#     D2h-grid.clone.h5.
#
# $ gauge-learn D2h-grid.clone.h5
#     classifies the samples according to the points P1 through P100 they have
#     been sampled from and performs the SVM optimization with respect to that,
#     storing the optimization result in D2h-grid.out.h5.
#
#     Alternatively, rather than sampling anew, one can recycle the samples of
#     the simulation in the `D2h-phase-diagram.clone.h5` file and reclassify
#     them according to grid points by overriding the relevant parameters on the
#     command line:
#
#     $ gauge-learn D2h-phase-diagram.clone.h5 \
#         --nu=0.1 \
#         --classifier.policy=fixed_from_sweep \
#         --outputfile=D2h-grid.out.h5
#
# $ gauge-segregate-phases D2h-grid.out.h5 --rhoc=0.9
#     performs the graph analysis. The graph is constructed by included an edge
#     in the graph if the bias of the corresponding decision function exceeds
#     the threshold value rho_c specified by the command line argument. The
#     program constructs the Laplacian matrix of the graph and calculates its
#     spectral decomposition. We advise to choose rho_c such that any higher
#     value would result in a disconnected graph (i.e. a degeneracy of the
#     eigenvalue zero of the Laplacian). For the parameters (and seed) chosen
#     here, this happens to be the case for rho_c ~ 1.6.
#
#     To visualize the resulting graph:

#
#     To visualize the Fiedler vector (eigenvector of the lowest non-zero
#     eigenvalue) whose entries indicate which phase the corresponding vertex
#     belongs to:
