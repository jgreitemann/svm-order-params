# Simulation of the gauge model with Oh (dodecahedral) symmetry
#
# The associated order parameter is a rank-4 tensor.
# All three colors per site are considered, and a single-site cluster is used.
#
# The critical temperature for this transition is T_c = 0.304 assuming J_1 = 1
# and J_3 = 1. When tuning the couplings (at constant temperature T = 1)
# instead, this translates into a critical coupling of J_1 = J_3 = 3.29.
# The "hyperplane" classifier is used to classify samples as "ORDERED" or
# "DISORDERED" relative to this critical coupling.
#
# 20 different couplings are drawn uniformly from the line from J_1 = J_3 = 1
# to J_1 = J_3 = 5 using the sweep policy "uniform_line".
# 250 samples of the spin configuration are taken per coupling.
#
# $ mpirun -n 4 gauge-sample Oh-hyperplane.ini                  (approx. 3 mins)
#     runs the simulation, collects samples and saves those to
#     Oh-hyperplane.clone.h5.
#
# $ gauge-learn Oh-hyperplane.clone.h5
#     classifies the samples as "ORDERED" or "DISORDERED" depending on which
#     side of the hyperplane their corresponding parameter point falls and
#     performs the SVM optimization with respect to that, storing the
#     optimization result in Oh-hyperplane.out.h5.
#
# $ gauge-coeffs Oh-hyperplane.out.h5 -u --blocks-only           (approx. 2 min)
#     extracts the block structure of the coefficient matrix describing the
#     order parameter the single transition between samples from the ORDERED and
#     DISORDERED phases.
#     By omitting the `--block-only` flag, the full coefficient matrix would be
#     output. While this is still feasible at rank 4, it would take more time
#     and write ~1 GB to disk.
#
# $ mpirun -n 4 gauge-test Oh-hyperplane.out.h5                 (approx. 4 mins)
#     runs the MC simulation at 16 points along the line from J_1 = J_3 = 1
#     to J_1 = J_3 = 5, measuring the SVM decision function as an observable.
#     The results are written to Oh-hyperplane.test.txt;
#     the decision function can be plotted using
#
#     gnuplot> plot 'Oh-hyperplane.test.txt' u 2:7:8 w yerrorlines
